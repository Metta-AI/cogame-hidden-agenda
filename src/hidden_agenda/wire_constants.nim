## The JS wire-constants block: the handful of engine constants the browser
## chrome must agree with (playback speeds, fps, the chrome sprite id).
##
## Forked from `coworld-ctf/src/ctf/wire_constants.nim`. THE GLOBAL KEEPS ITS
## NAME: `client/chrome_common.js` reads `window.CTF_WIRE` at its line 72 and
## that file ships BYTE-FOR-BYTE, so renaming the global would force a byte
## change in a file that must not change.

proc jsIntArray(values: openArray[int]): string =
  result = "["
  for i, v in values:

  ",chromeSpriteId:" & $BroadcastChromeSpriteId &
  ",cell:" & $CellPx &
  ",boardW:" & $BoardW &
  ",boardH:" & $BoardH &
  "};"

const WireConstantsMarker* = "<!-- WIRE_CONSTANTS -->"
  ## The placeholder the client HTML carries where the block belongs (before
  ## any script that reads window.CTF_WIRE).

proc spliceWireConstants*(page: string): string =
  ## Replaces the marker with the inline constants script. A page without the
  ## marker passes through unchanged.
